# Event-Feedback-Clustering

In today's competitive business landscape, understanding customer feedback has become crucial 
for organizations to improve their products and services and enhance customer satisfaction. This 
project presents an innovative approach to analyse and derive valuable insights from customer 
feedback data using advanced data analysis techniques.
The project begins by collecting a substantial dataset comprising 60,000 rows and 19 columns of 
customer feedback from event feedback reviews. The dataset undergoes rigorous validation and 
preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency.
To address the challenge of high dimensionality and extract meaningful patterns, Principal 
Component Analysis (PCA) is applied. PCA reduces the data's dimensionality while retaining its 
essential information, facilitating efficient visualization and interpretation. K-means clustering 
algorithm is employed to segment the customer feedback into distinct clusters based on shared 
characteristics. Each cluster represents a group of customers with similar feedback sentiments and 
preferences.
The clustered data, along with the results of PCA, are integrated into Power BI, a powerful 
business intelligence tool. Power BI is utilized to create interactive and visually engaging 
dashboards, enabling users to explore and interpret the clustered customer feedback data 
effectively.
Through insightful cluster trait analysis, the project uncovers unique patterns, sentiments, and 
preferences associated with each customer feedback cluster. These findings empower businesses to 
make data-driven decisions and derive actionable recommendations for product optimization, 
service enhancements, and targeted marketing strategies.
The project's outcomes include enhanced customer understanding, improved product offerings, and 
increased customer satisfaction, all contributing to the organization's growth and success in the 
market.

The project follows a systematic methodology for customer feedback analysis:
• Data Collection: Gather feedback data from multiple sources and ensure data integrity.
• Data Preprocessing: Clean and validate the data, handling missing values and outliers.
• K-means Clustering: Apply K-means algorithm to group similar feedback points into 
clusters.
• PCA: Implement PCA for dimensionality reduction while preserving important features.
• Power BI Integration: Import clustered data and PCA results into Power BI for 
visualization.
• Interactive Visualization: Create interactive dashboards to present cluster insights.
• Cluster Trait Analysis: Analyse cluster characteristics and interpret customer 
preferences.
• Data-Driven Recommendations: Derive actionable recommendations based on the 
analysis.

We outline the key findings and insights obtained from the clustering process. The results will 
include the following aspects:
- Number of Clusters: We report the optimal number of clusters (K) determined through the elbow 
method or other evaluation techniques for the K-means algorithm.
- Dimensionality Reduction: We present the PCA results, showcasing the most significant 
components that explain the variance in the feedback data while reducing its dimensionality.
- Cluster Characteristics: We discuss the traits and patterns identified within each customer 
feedback cluster. This includes common sentiments, preferences, and themes expressed by 
customers in each cluster.
These are the illustartions of Dashboards built
